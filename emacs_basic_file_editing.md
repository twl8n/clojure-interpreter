#### Emacs Basic File Editing

We assume that you know the location of your file.

Open file directly using the mouse.

1) Click the icon that looks like an open file folder. The cursor will jump into the "mini-buffer" at the bottom of the window.

2) Start typing folder and file names. Emacs will auto-complete (especially if you have ido and
ido-everywhere). Keep typing until the file name is complete. If you make a mistake and see "[No Match]", use
the backspace. (We will learn how to use the auto-complete later.)

3) Press enter.
4) The file opens. You may now edit.

(Issues: there is no "undo" in the Minibuffer. Instead you must continue navigating, or cancel.) Cancel with control-g or Menus -> Minibuf -> Quit.
